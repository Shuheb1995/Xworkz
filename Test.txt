1.  Constructors are special methods which are used to initialize the object.
everytime an object is created using new keyword, tleast one constructor must be called.
if there is no constructor, the java compiler will provide a default constructor implicitly.
rules for constructor are:
* constructor name should be same as class name.
* Consttructor has no returntype.
There are two typees of Constructor:
* Default Constructor 
* Parameterised Constructor

DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR: Consttructor which has no Parameter is known as Default constructor.
PARAMETERISED CONSTRUCTOR: Constructor which has specific numbers of parameters is known as parameterised constructor.




2.  Features Of JAVA:
*Java is Simple 
*Java is Secure
*Java is Object Oriented
*Java is Platform Independent
*Java is Robust
*Java is Multithreaded

Java is Simple: Java is easy to understand and easy to write, so Java is Simple.

Java is Secure: Java is a Interpreted Language, it does not run directly on the OS's, 
                it has a Java Virtual Machine(JVM) which runs the java, so the viruses,
				hackers cant attack it,so the java is secure.
				
Java is Object Oriented: Language uses object to communicate is known as Object Oriented programming Language.
                         even java almost uses the object to communicate so java is Object Oriented and it is time convinient.
						 
Java is Platform Independent: Java compiler converts the source code to the byte code(.class file), this byte code can run on any platform
                              this bytecode makes Java Platform Independent.
							  
							  
							  
							  
							  
3.  C++ is a Programmming Language
    Java is also a  Programmming Language

C++ is not much Secure.
Java is Secure.

C++ runs directly on Operating Systems(OS)
Java does'nt runs directly on OS

Java is Object Oriented
C++ is not Object Oriented



4.  JDK(Java Development Kit)- this is a application of Java.
    JRE(Java Runtime Environment)- it present inside the JDK which creates runtime environmentt for java programme.
	JVM(Java Virtual Machine)- It is a small machine present inside java which contains  a compiler and converts the byte code to
                               Machine level format and execute the programme.


5.   Types of Memory areas allocated by JVM;
     Instance Pool- here the copy of the data will be saved. if the data is same the it wo'nt create another copy of that data
                    It will  save the same previous data and address it.
     Heap Memory- In the Heap Memory the copy of the object is stored.


6.   Methods
     Method is a block or set of codes, whichperforms a certain task or function. it provide reusability of codes user do not 
     want to write the codes again and again. 
     the most important Method in Java is Main method because main method is the starting point for JVM to start the execution of 
     of Java Programme.
    
     syntax for Method is:
     
     Public static void methodname (Parameter list);

     Public - Access Specifier- it makes the method accessible in all the classes.
     Static - Non Access Specifier- it is a Keyword which calls the method without creating an object.
	 void - Return type - if we use the datatypes instead of void then method returns the value of that datatype.
            if we use void then method wo'nt return anything.
     Method Name- Mthod should have suitable name. The Method name should be corresponding or similar  to functionality
                	 of the method.	 
	Parameter list- parameter list is a data provide to a method, consist of datatypes and the arguements 
	                which are superated by comma and covered by parantheses.
					
					
					
					
7. Method Overloading 
   Method overloading is nothing but declaring same method in one class.
   Rules for Method Overloading are:
   * parameter with different datatypes.
   * parameter with different numbers.
   * order of parameter.
   
   
   Example.
   public class MethodOverlaoding{
	
	public static void call(){
	System.out.println("call ulaga");
	}
	
	public static void call(int num){
	System.out.println(" Called Ulaga");
	}
	public static void call(long number,String recieved){
	System.out.println(" did Ulaga recieved call");
	}
	public static vooid main(String[] args){
	
	call();
	call(573201);
	call(8217650069L, "yes");
	
	}
	} 
   
   
   
8. Constructor- use to initialise the object.
   Method - use to initialise the value of variables.
   
   constructor- constructor name should be same as class name.
   Method- method name can be same as class name or not.
   
   contructor-java compileer provides default constructor implicitly.
   Method- java compileer wo'nt provide any Method implicitly, user have declare it.
   
   constructor- it dont give any returntype.
   Method- it gives a returntypes of given datatypes.
   
   
   
   
9.  Static Variable - A variable which uses static keyword is known as Static Variable, it is accessible without creating any object.
    Static Method - A Method which uses static keyword is known as Static Method, it call the Method without creating any object.
	Static Block - A block which is used to initialise the Static variable is known as Static block.
	
	
	
10. Constructor Overloading:  in Java, constructor overloading is technique of caling more than one constructor with different
    parameter list. they are arranged in a way that each constructor should perform different task.
	
	
	examople.  
	public class ConsOverlaoding{
	
	public ConsOverlaoding(){
	System.out.println("default constructor");
	}
	
	public ConsOverlaoding(int num){
	System.out.println("Parameterised constructor");
	}
	public ConsOverlaoding(float percentage){
	System.out.println("Constructor Overloading");
	}
	public static vooid main(String[] args){
	
	ConsOverlaoding display= new ConsOverlaoding();
	
	display.num;
	display.percentage;
	}
	}
